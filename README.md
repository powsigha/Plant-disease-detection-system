Problem statement:
In agriculture, plant diseases can result in large financial losses, and prompt and precise
identification is essential to efficient disease control.
Objectives:
The goal is to spot the disease in leaves early and take the necessary steps to prevent it.
We frequently employ image processing techniques to quickly classify diseases and perform
disease-specific diagnostics. This method will lead to an increase in crop productivity.
Methodology:
Image processing and machine learning techniques are used to detect plant diseases. The
project uses deep learning feature extraction to identify disease, and the steps involved in
disease detection are image acquisition, pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and
classification.
Key results:
Data Collection: Processed datasets of plant images using training methods such as
augmentation, normalization, and scaling.
Model Training: Used CNN and other pre-trained deep learning models for disease
classification and feature extraction.
Real-Time Detection: Put in place a system that analyzes photos of plants and forecasts
diseases and potential treatments.

Conclusion:
Although the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques in plant disease
identification is a quickly developing subject with encouraging outcomes, there are still
issues and constraints that need to be resolved. These algorithms have shown promise in
reliably identifying and classifying plant diseases..
